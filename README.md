the sequel nobody asked for, from the franchise nobody loves

`index.js`: Starting point for code, initializing Phaser and whatnot

`menu.js`: The main menu. Allows player to enter the game.

`dungeon-scene.js`: Main body of the game, with Waluigi and the dungeon. This will eventually become the part of the game where you explore the school.

`tilemap-visibility.js`: Controls the visibility of the different rooms within the dungeon.

`tile-mapping.js`: Gives ids to the different tiles from the main tileset. We'll make our own tiles eventually.
